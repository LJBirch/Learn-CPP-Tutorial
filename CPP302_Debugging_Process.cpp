	/*
		Once a problem has been identified, debugging the problem generally consists of five steps:

		1) Find the root cause of the problem (usually the line of code that’s not working).

		2) Ensure you understand why the issue is occurring.

		3) Determine how you’ll fix the issue.

		4) Repair the issue causing the problem.

		5) Retest to ensure the problem has been fixed and no new problems have emerged.
