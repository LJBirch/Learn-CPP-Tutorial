	// Plan out your program before you start, this will save a lot of frustration.

	// Step 1: Define your goal
	// - Should be able to state this in sentence or two.
	// - Often useful to express this as a user-facing outcome.
	
	// Step 2: Define requirments
	// - Requirements are the constraints that your solutions needs to abide (could be budget, timeline, space, memory, etc...).
	// - Its also the capabilities the program must exhibit in order to meet the users' needs.
	// - Should be focused on the "what", not the "how".

	// Step 3: Define your tools, targets and backup plan
	// - This could be any of the following (or even more):
	// - Defining what target architecture and/or OS your program will run on.
	// - Determining what set of tools you will be using.
	// - Determining whether you will write your program alone or as part of a team.
	// - Defining your testing / feedback / release strategy.
	// - Determining how you will back up your code.

	// Step 4: Break hard problems down into easy problems
	// - Take complicated tasks and use the top down or bottom up method to break them down.
	// - Break hard subtasks down even further when possible.
	// - By continously doing this, we end up with many manageable tasks that make up the complex task.
	// - Using the top down or bottom up method allows us to organise the tasks into hierarchies.

	// Step 5: Figure out the sequence of events
	// - Once the program has a structure, its time to determine how link all the tasks together.
	// - You should determine the sequences of events that will be performed.

	// Implementation step 1:
	// - Outline your main function.
	// - Comment out your function calls until you're ready to address this (or stub out your functions, so the program will compile).
	
	// Implementation step 2:
	// - Define your function prototype (inputs and ouputs).
	// - Write the function.
	// - Test the function.

	// Implementation step 3:
	// - Test the whole program to ensure it works.

	// Advice:
	// - Keep your programs simple to start with.
	// - Add features over time.
	// - Focus on one area at a time.
	// - Test each piece of code as you go.
	// - Dont invest in perfecting early code.
