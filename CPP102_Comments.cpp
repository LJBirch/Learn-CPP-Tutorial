// Comments should describe what the library, program, or function they're refeering to, does.

// Should be placed immediately proceeding what is being refeered to.

// Comments should try to explain WHY the code is doing something, the code itself should be good enough to show WHAT it is doing.

// Comments should assume that the person reading it doesnt know what your code does.
