#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	// The smallest unit of memory is a binary digit (also called a bit).
	// It holds a value of either 0 or 1.
	// A random segment of memory would therefore look something like this: 011010100101010.
	
	// Memory is organized into sequential units called memory addresses.
	// This tells us the location at which a specific contents is located in memory.
	
	// Each memory address holds 1 byte of data.
	// A byte is a group of bits that are operated on as a unit.
	// The modern standard for a byte is 8 sequential bits.

	// As all data on a computer is just a sequence of bits, we use a data type to tell the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way.
	// Values in C++ get converted into a sequence of bits or retrieve sequence of bits to convert to values.
	// The inner workings of this are carried out by the compilier and the CPU.

	// C++ comes with a set of built-in support for many different data types.
	// These are referred to as fundamental data types (often called basic types, primitive types, or built-in types).
	
	// See https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-fundamental-data-types/ for a full list of fundamental data types.
